    <h1>My Family</h1>

    <p>I come from a strong and loving family that has shaped my life and supported my dreams. At the center of our home are my parents — my pillars of strength and wisdom.</p>

    <p>My father, <strong>Vincent Osoro</strong>, is a quiet, hardworking, and disciplined man. He has always led by example, teaching us the value of patience, humility, and consistency. His calm guidance continues to inspire me.</p>

    <p>My mother, <strong>Lenah Moraa Onyancha</strong>, is the heart of our family. She is kind, prayerful, and nurturing — always encouraging us to pursue our goals with confidence. Her love and determination have been my biggest source of motivation.</p>

    <p>I am blessed with two amazing siblings. My brother, <strong>Dislaus Kamanda Osoro</strong>, is intelligent, protective, and focused. My sister, <strong>Henrietta Kwamboka Osoro</strong>, is cheerful, creative, and full of life. Together, we support each other through every challenge and celebration.</p>

    <p>Our home is a place of respect, culture, and laughter. I am proud of where I come from — and thankful for the family that made me who I am.</p>

    <h1>My Education</h1>

    <p>My journey in education began at <strong>Kiomakondo D.O.K. Primary School</strong>, nestled right in my village. I worked hard and excelled in my KCPE, scoring an impressive <span class="highlight">376 marks</span>. This was a proud moment for both me and my family.</p>

    <p>I was then admitted to one of the top schools in the country — <strong>Nyambaria High School</strong>. There, I committed myself to excellence in academics and discipline. After four years of determination, I emerged with an <span class="highlight">A– (74 points)</span> in KCSE.</p>

    <p>Fueled by my passion for design and creativity, I earned a place at <strong>Kenyatta University</strong>, where I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Architecture</strong>. This program challenges me to think critically, design with purpose, and create with heart.</p>

    <p>My dream is to become a successful and impactful architect — one who transforms not just buildings, but communities. I want to blend art and engineering to solve real-world problems, especially in rural and developing areas.</p>

    <p>I believe education is more than grades — it’s about building character, vision, and responsibility. I am grateful for every step I’ve taken, and every step ahead that will shape the architect I’m becoming.</p>

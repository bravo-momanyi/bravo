    <h1>Our Journey Together</h1>

    <p>
      In the pages of my life, there are many stories — but few as precious as the one I share with <strong>Bathsheba Nyomenda Otudo</strong>, known fondly as <em>Sheba</em>. She is not only my closest friend but also a constant pillar of support and inspiration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sheba is a student at <strong>Kenyatta University</strong>, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in <span class="highlight">Occupational Therapy</span>. Her compassion, intelligence, and commitment to helping others make her a remarkable woman. She is focused, graceful, and carries a rare strength that uplifts everyone around her.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a world filled with distractions, she reminds me of what truly matters — love, kindness, and purpose. Her encouragement fuels my dreams, and her presence brings me peace. Our relationship is built on mutual respect, shared goals, deep trust, and continuous growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not perfect, but together we are strong. We support each other in academics, in family, in hopes, and in faith. I consider it a blessing to walk this journey of life alongside her — learning, laughing, growing, and planning a future of impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe love should not only be felt but also acknowledged, and today, I choose to honor Sheba publicly as someone who adds genuine value to my life.
